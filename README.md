UMUC_CMIS242_Project3
This is simply my project for UMUC class CMIS 242, project #3
All it does is use a GUI to calculate a sequence of numbers (not too far different from a fibonacci sequence) using both
iterative and recursive methods. Then on windowClose it outputs a text file for 10 passes of each method that records
the efficiency (i.e. the number of loops through each method).
